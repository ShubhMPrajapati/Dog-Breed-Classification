# 🐶 Dog Vision - Dog Breed Classifier

This project is a deep learning-based image classifier that identifies dog breeds from images.  
It leverages **TensorFlow**, **Keras**, and **Transfer Learning** with pretrained models to achieve accurate predictions.

## 📌 Features
- Classifies dog images into multiple breeds.  
- Uses **TensorFlow Hub MobileNetV2** as the feature extractor.  
- Implements **data augmentation** and **batch processing** for efficient training.  
- Visualizes training results and model predictions.  

## ⚙️ Tech Stack
- **Python**
- **TensorFlow / Keras**
- **TensorFlow Hub**
- **NumPy & Pandas**
- **Matplotlib**

## 🚀 How It Works
1. Preprocess and batch input images.  
2. Train a deep learning model using transfer learning.  
3. Evaluate performance using accuracy and loss plots.  
4. Predict the breed of unseen dog images.
